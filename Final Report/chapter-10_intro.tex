what is a bulding part?
why building part and not room level?
why just the architecture faculty?

Indoor movement was identified and visualized along the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Delineate building parts based on the layout of access points
and the division of the building (e.g. department, canteen, building wing), and
group the access point into building parts.
    \item Identify movements in the data between building parts.
    \item Create a route network that connects the building parts and
    is constrained on the corridors of the building.
    \item Assign the movements to the route network.
    \item Visualize the movement along the indoor network.
\end{enumerate}
