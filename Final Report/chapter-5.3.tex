Privacy

This project focuses on identifying common movement patterns, ignoring
the individual, therefore we did not test explicity whether is possible to
identify individuals or not from the data. However, based on our findings about
the operation of the \textit{eduroam} Wi-Fi network and about the methods that
are used to identify movemebt patterns, we can make the following assumptions.

Movement patterns are rather unique, therefore it is possible to match them to
individuals even if maybe not in every case. However, in order to do so it is
necessary to have additional data available. This additional data itself is
often considered private data, e.g. the complete weekly schedule of the person.
Provided that timetables are openly accessible and the occupation of the
individual is known, then his movement pattern may be identified in the dataset.

The availablitity of a detailed access point map makes it easier to identify
individuals by allowing a more detailed movement analysis (e.g. on building part
level). It reduces the ambiguity that is still present in building level
movement analysis.
