why?
constrained space

movement is constrained on the corridors

always assume the shortest route between two building parts
even if the person took an another route in reality, still the sortest route is
calculated, this is a necessary limitation in the method because the Wi-Fi
system doesn't allow to record fine grained movement (because of the five
minute scan interval)
