During the fourth quarter of the first year of the MSc Programme Geomatics for the Built Environment at the TU Delft, the Geomatics Synthesis Project (GSP) takes place. This report is part of this framework and in this project, students will apply all their knowledge they have acquired during the courses while working in groups of five or six students. The students will gain experience throughout the entire process of project management, data processing, data analysis, application and presentation. \\\\
This year, the GSP focusses on Wi-Fi tracking data from the eduroam network of the TU Delft. The student will be divided into three groups, each researching one of three different topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Identifying occupancy
\item Identifying movement patterns
\item Identifying activities
\end{itemize}
This project is dedicated to the second topic, identifying movement patterns. The project requires 3 main documents: \begin {enumerate*} [label=\itshape\arabic*\upshape),font={\color{red!0!black}\bfseries}] \item the baseline review; \item the mid term review, and \item the final review
\end{enumerate*}
This document embodies the final review and was created to provide the students, the supervisor(s) and other involved parties with an overview of the project. The document includes the problem description, development process, results, conclusions and recommendations for future work.
