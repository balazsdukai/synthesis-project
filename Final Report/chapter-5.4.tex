Data accuracy and validity of the results

The spatial accuracy of the Wi-Fi log datased is defined by the range of the
APs. Although we do not have information on the exact range of the differente
APs, we estimate the range ot be a few tens of meters. Therefore, if a user is
recorded by a specifis AP, in reality he can be anywhere around the AP in its
range.

The temporal accuracy of the Wi-Fi log dataset is defined by the five minute
campus-wide scan interval of the \textit{eduroam} system. It means that all APs
on the TU Delf campus scan at the same moment in approximately five minute
intervals. Therefore, it is possible that the user is already at a given AP, but
he will be first recorded at the next scan round, or the user alread left the AP
but that also will be only recorded at the next scan round.

\textbf{Validity of the results}

The scope of the project did not extend to test the results extensively, however
some conclusions can be drawn by using our local knowledge of the life on the
campus.

the main movement on the campus is between the Aula and the Library

movement peaks match the lecture hours closely
