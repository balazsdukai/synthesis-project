During the fourth quarter of the first year of the MSc Programme Geomatics for the Built Environment at
the Delft University of Technology, the [Geomatics Synthesis Project (GSP)](http://www.tudelft.nl/en/study/master-of-science/master-programmes/geomatics/programme/synthesis-project/) takes place. In this project students apply all their knowledge they have acquired during the courses while working
in groups of five or six. In the prcess they gain experience in project
management, data processing, data analysis, application and presentation.

In 2016 the overreaching topic of the GSP was *Monitoring flows and occupation patterns with Wi-Fi*. In the scope of this topic, the project team *A2B* focused on *Identifying movement patterns from large scale Wi-Fi-based location data*.
