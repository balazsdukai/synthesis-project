-Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) are widely used for indoor positioning of mobile devices within this network. The use of the Wi\ -Fi network to estimate the location of people is an attractive approach, since Wi\ -Fi access points (AP) are often available in indoor environments. Furthermore, smart phones are becoming essential in daily life, making it convincing to track mobile devices. This provides a platform to track people by using Wi\ -Fi monitoring technology. Knowledge of people’s locations and related routine activities are important for numerous activities, such as urban planning, emergency rescue and management of buildings.

 To understand the human motion behaviour many studies are conducted based on data collection of GPS receivers. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is commonly used to track people in large scale environments. However due to poor quality of received signals from satellites in urban or indoor environments, GNSS receivers are not suitable in these environments. This led to the development of alternative technologies to track people’s locations, including Bluetooth, Dead Reckoning, Radio frequency identification (RFID), ultra-wideband (UWB) and WLAN (Mautz, 2012). WLAN has the advantage of widespread deployment, low cost and with the use of a smartphone as a receiver, the possibility to track a large amount of people.
